# IRProject

We are usig three indexes in this project:
1 Body Index
2.Title Index
3.Anchor Text Index

We are also using a csv file that contains data regarding page views and a dictionary which contains data regarding page ranks.

each function uses a differnet data set except for the search function which uses both the Body Index and the Title Index.
